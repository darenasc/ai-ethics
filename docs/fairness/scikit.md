**Description of the tool**

Python package designed for data scientists and model builders. Build on top of Sklearn, Scikit-fairness offers tools for various stages of model building pipeline to measure group level fairness and mitigate bias.

**Best for: **

This tool is fairly basic, but seems to do what it does well. This tool is best for data scientists who want an initial look at how to analyse their models for fairness.

**Pros & cons**

Pros:

  * Can integrate fairly seamlessly into an existing logistic regression pipeline

  * Built on top of sklearn

  * Tackles pre-processing, model building and post-modelling evaluation and correction stages of pipeline

  * Simple Pip install

**Limitations, especially any technical issues**

- Fairness optimisation technique is limited to training Logistic Regression Models

- Works on classification and regression

- Limited to Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity Difference

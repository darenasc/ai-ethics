# [Machine Intelligence Ethics Framework](https://www.migarage.ai/ethics-framework/)

We evaluated Digital Catapult’s comprehensive [set of questions](https://www.migarage.ai/ethics-framework/) aimed at early stage development in ML solutions

### Overall evaluation

#### Technical Implementation

- _Useful:_ 5/5 - but only for identification of issues, not solutions
- _Comprehensive:_ 5/5
- _Technical scalability:_ n/a
- _Easy to customize (data):_ n/a - might want to add guidance notes to help people answer the questions
- _Easy to customize (visualizations / analyses):_ n/a
- _Easy to integrate:_ 3/5
- _Robustness:_ 4/5

#### User-friendliness (system usability scale)

_Answer with strongly agree (5), agree (4), neutral (3), disagree (2), strongly disagree (1)_

_Feel free to add comments and justifications!_

1. _I think that I would like to use this system frequently:_ 4 or agree

2. _I found the system unnecessarily complex:_

3. _I thought the system was easy to use:_

4. _I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system:_

5. _I found the various functions in this system were well integrated:_

6. _I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system:_

7. _I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly:_

8. _I found the system very cumbersome to use:_

9. _I felt very confident using the system:_

10. _I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system:_

### Description of the tool

_What is its purpose?_ 
- structured questions framework, designed to ‘out’ ethical issues

_Who is the intended user?_
- individuals and organisations - in practice, designed for startups where all the decision-makers are in one room

_What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)?_
- services and products that use data and algorithms

### Best for:

_What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?_

- uncovering ethical issues
- may not be useful if you don’t know the source of the data

### Pros & cons

_What are the benefits of this tool?_

- spells out why these questions need answering

_What are the challenges in using this tool?_

- doesn’t tell you how to fix the problems

- not easy to tell when to think about which questions (at what stage of development process)

- needs to be iterated and regularly reviewed as part of a process

### Limitations, especially any technical issues

_E.g. difficult to integrate or customize_

- quite involved
